Installation Instructions for nextwall
**************************************

1) Configuring the nextwall build

In the top level directory from where you extracted nextwall, run the following
commands:

mkdir build
cd build/
ccmake ..

This will present you with a simple console based GUI of options for nextwall.
First press 'c' to run the configure script. Review the options and change what
you think is necessary. Press 'c' to run the configure script again. Press 'g'
to generate the make files and exit.

Uninstallation Instructions
***************************

Removing all installed nextwall files
=====================================

Change to the build folder which you created in the top level directory
from where you extracted nextwall:

cd build/

And run the uninstall command (as root):

make uninstall


Alternative uninstallation
==========================

Alternatively, you can remove the files listed in the install_manifest.txt file
which has the same result as the 'make uninstall' command.

xargs rm < install_manifest.txt
