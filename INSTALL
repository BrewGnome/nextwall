Installation Instructions

Standad Installation
====================

Building and installing this Python script is usually one simple command
that needs to be run from a shell prompt. Open a Terminal window to get
a shell prompt. Then run the following command as Root from the folder
that has the 'setup.py' file:

	python setup.py install

On some systems you need to precede the command with 'sudo' to run it as
Root:

	sudo python setup.py install
